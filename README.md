# Student Form Task

## 📋 Overview

This project is a simple web application that allows users to add and delete student records dynamically. It is built using HTML, JavaScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS. The application features a form where users can input student details, which are then displayed in a table below. Users can also delete individual student entries from the table.

## ✅ Features

- Add student details (e.g., name, age, roll number).
- Save button to store student information into a table.
- Delete button to remove specific student entries.
- Clean and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 How It Works
